      <p><em>To be accepted into the program, an individual must be found eligible 
      (low-income, dislocated worker, under age 25 with a barrier to employment). 
      A career planner may request additional documentation (i.e. written 
      notification of layoff, high school transcript/drop out letter, family ID) 
      as proof of your&nbsp;eligibility.</em></p>
  - heading: Meet with Career Planner
    icon: assets/img/planner-icon.png
    content: >-
      <p>A Career Planner will contact you to set up an appointment to 
      discuss your application and develop an Individual Employment 
      Plan, which is a plan of action to help you reach your employment 
      goals. The career planner will review your documentation and will 
      determine your eligibility to receive WIOA&nbsp;assistance.</p>
  - heading: Basic Skills Testing
    icon: assets/img/skills-test-icon.png
    content: >-
      <p>TABE testing is used to effectively assess skill and knowledge of 
      individuals applying for the WIOA scholarship. The intent is to 
      ensure individuals do not require remedial education prior to attending 
      training. Individuals who have an associate degree, recently passed a 
      placement test or college course (math and english) may be <em>exempt</em> 
      from&nbsp;testing.</p>
  - heading: Scholarship Awarded
    icon: assets/img/award-icon.png
    content: >-
      <p>When all previous steps are completed, a Career Planner will 
      discuss with you how payment will work for tuition, fees, books, 
      supplies, and/or gas reimbursement. As long as you continue to 
      meet WIOA grant requirements, you will remain eligible to receive 
      scholarship funding each semester through the end of your&nbsp;program.</p>

          <p>
            We recommend applying for the grant if your intent is to 
            upgrade your skills and obtain employment in an in-demand
            occupation. Below are program requirements you need to be 
            aware of when applying for the scholarship program.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You must be able to complete your program in 3 years; taking 
              a minimum of 6 credit hours per (fall and spring) semester. 
              Attending summer classes is encouraged, but not required.
            </li>
            <li>
              You are required to apply for federal financial aid (FAFSA) 
              each year you are on the program and submit a copy of your
              confirmation email to your Career Planner.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is important and to your benefit to contact your Career 
              Planner regularly (monthly). Especially if your personal
              information (address, phone number, email, etc.) should 
              change while on the program.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any classes taken outside of the scope of your program will 
              need to be paid for by another funding source and cannot be 
              covered by this grant.
            </li>
            <li>
              At the end of each semester, please forward your grades, a 
              copy of any certificates/licenses/diplomas earned (if any),
              and your class schedule/tuition bill for the next semester 
              to your Career Planner.
            </li>
            <li>
              If at any time you need to change your program or drop/withdraw 
              from a course, notify your Career Planner in advance to ensure 
              no loss of your scholarship.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is important to notify your Career Planner of any employment 
              changes or if you need to apply for unemployment benefits while 
              on the program.
            </li>
            <li>
              At the end of the program, your Career Planner will remain 
              in contact with you for up to a year to assist with finding
              a job and ensure you are successfully employed.
            </li>
          </ul>
