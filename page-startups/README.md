# Page Startup Files

> Files with the correct front-matter fields for making pages fast

Page startup files are named according to which layout they are setup for (i.e. in `_layouts` dir). To use them:

1. Copy-and-paste the desired page-startup file into the appropriate directory for the page you want to create.
2. Rename the file to `index.html` (or an appropriate name if not in it's pretty-permalink folder.)
3. Update the front-matter fields to appropriate values for: `baseurl`, `title`, & `description`
4. Add content.
