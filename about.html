          <p>
            We are part of a network of workforce development federal and state agencies. Our purpose is to help individuals achieve
            their career goals through resume development, job search tactics, financial support while attending school to earn a
            certificate or degree for a high growth occupation, and more. We are not a staffing agency, but we do offer tools and
            resources to help individuals successfully meet their goals. We also assist local employers with recruiting to help meet
            hiring needs.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-1">
            Our work is driven by the <strong>Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) grant</strong>. WIOA is awarded by the U.S. Department
            of Labor&apos;s Employment and Training Administration. WIOA is landmark legislation designed to
          </p>

            <li>Help get Americans, including youth and those with significant barriers to employment, into high-quality jobs and careers and</li>
            <li>Help employers hire and retain skilled workers.</li>
            <li>Help job seekers access employment, education, training, and support services to succeed in the labor market</li>
            <li>Match employers with the skilled workers they need to compete in the global economy.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The WIOA grant for Kankakee County, Illinois, is administered through <strong>Kankakee Community College</strong> as the grant recipient
            for both Livingston and Kankakee counties, awarded by the Grundy Livingston Kankakee Workforce Board. Kankakee Workforce
            Services is a One Stop Center located in Bradley, Illinois, which facilitates the WIOA title I Adult, Dislocated Worker,

                The WIOA grant is funded by the Grundy Livingston Kankakee Workforce Board.
                The Workforce Board oversees and sets policy for workforce development and
                training programs for Grundy, Livingston, and Kankakee Counties. It is one
                of 26 local boards across the state of Illinois. The Workforce Board is
                comprised of a variety of private and public sector members representing
                industries from across the three-county area, as well as public sector and
                social service agencies involved in workforce development. Board activities
                and programs are designed to meet both the needs of the communities'
                businesses, job seekers and those who want to further their&nbsp;careers.

            Illinois Community Colleges offer Adult Education & Literacy and Career &
            Technical Education programs. Adult Education in Illinois provides services
            that assist adults in improving their skills, achieving their educational
            goals, and transitioning to further education or employment. Career and
            Technical Education (CTE) prepares individuals for high-skill, in-demand
            employment that furthers Illinois&apos; global&nbsp;competitiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA), Title II of the Workforce
            Innovation and Opportunity Act, supports and promotes adult education and
            literacy services that help adults get the basic skills they need, including
            reading, writing, math, English language proficiency, and problem-solving to
            be productive workers, family members, and citizens. The purpose of the program
            is to provide educational opportunities below the postsecondary level for
            individuals 16 or older, who are not currently enrolled in school, who lack a
            high school diploma, or who lack the basic skills to function effectively in
            the workplace and in their daily lives. Instructional services are offered in
            four program&nbsp;areas:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>ABE - Basic skills instruction below the high school level;</li>
            <li>ASE - High school level instruction;</li>
            <li>IELCE - Integrated English literacy and civics education; and</li>
            <li>ELA - English language acquisition instruction.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Career and technical education (CTE) programs are offered at the postsecondary
            level, authorized under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act
            of 2006. CTE prepares learners for college and careers by providing academic
            and technical skills needed to succeed in the workforce. CTE aligns education
            and the workforce to ensure that today&apos;s students are learning the skills
            needed in the competitive job&nbsp;market.
